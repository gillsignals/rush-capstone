## Title reconciliation

This script converts titles in `audioFeatures.RData` to match titles in `rawLyrics.RData`.


```{r}
load("rawLyrics.RData")
load("audioFeatures.RData")
lyricTitles <- data.frame(track = lyricsPerSong$track)
audioTitles <- data.frame(track = unique(audioFeatures$track_name))
anti_join(audioTitles, lyricTitles)
```
